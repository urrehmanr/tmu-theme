# TMU Field Implementation Summary

## Critical Findings from Plugin Analysis

After deep analysis of the TMU plugin's field structure, I've identified several critical requirements that must be addressed in our theme implementation to ensure complete field parity.

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The current documentation steps do not properly account for the **massive complexity** of the cast/crew field system. This needs immediate attention.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Cast/Crew System Complexity**
- **12 departments** with conditional job dropdowns
- **800+ total job options** across all departments
- **Nested group fields** with complex relationships
- **Post-type relationships** to people database
- **Conditional field visibility** based on department selection

### 2. **Missing Field Categories in Current Docs**
The documentation steps need to properly address:
- ✅ **TV Season Fields** - Simple but missing
- ✅ **TV Episode Fields** - Complex cast/crew system
- ✅ **People Relationship Fields** - Family, social media, spouse connections
- ✅ **Conditional Field Logic** - Department-based job visibility
- ✅ **Group Field Cloning** - Star cast, social media accounts
- ✅ **Cross-Post-Type Relationships** - Known for, spouse, cast/crew

### 3. **Database Schema Requirements**
- **Custom table storage** for all metadata
- **Exact table preservation** from plugin
- **Complex relationship mapping** between tables

## 🔧 **Required Documentation Updates**

### **Step 07: Gutenberg Block System** *(MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED)*
Current step mentions basic blocks but misses the cast/crew complexity.

**Must Add:**
- Cast/Crew Manager Block with department/job system
- Star Cast Block with person relationships  
- People Selector with AJAX search
- Department-Job Conditional Logic
- Social Media Account Cloner
- Video/Image Gallery Blocks

### **Step 03: Database Migration** *(UPDATE NEEDED)*
Must ensure all custom tables are created with exact schema:
- `tmu_movies` with all metadata fields
- `tmu_tv_series` with series-specific fields
- `tmu_tv_series_seasons` with season data
- `tmu_tv_series_episodes` with episode data
- `tmu_people` with person/family data
- `tmu_dramas` with drama metadata

### **Step 05: Post Types Registration** *(UPDATE NEEDED)*
Must include all post types:
- ✅ Movie *(covered)*
- ✅ TV Series *(covered)*
- ❌ **Season** *(missing)*
- ❌ **Episode** *(missing)*
- ✅ People *(covered)*
- ❌ **Drama** *(missing)*
- ❌ **Video** *(missing)*

## 🎯 **Implementation Priority Matrix**

### **Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure**
1. **Database Schema** - Custom tables with exact field mapping
2. **Post Type Registration** - All 6 post types
3. **Departments/Jobs Config** - Complete job options (800+ items)
4. **Relationship System** - Person connections

### **Phase 2: Cast/Crew System**  
1. **Cast/Crew Manager Block** - Main complexity
2. **Person Selection Interface** - AJAX-powered search
3. **Department/Job Conditionals** - Dynamic dropdowns
4. **Star Cast Block** - Simplified cast input

### **Phase 3: Advanced Fields**
1. **Social Media Groups** - Cloneable platform accounts
2. **Media Galleries** - Video/image management
3. **Family Relationships** - Parents, spouse, siblings
4. **TV Series Specifics** - Seasons, episodes, networks

## 🎬 **Cast/Crew System Architecture**

This is the most complex part requiring special attention:

```
Cast/Crew System:
├── Star Cast (Simple)
│   ├── Person Selection (People Post Type)
│   └── Character Name (Text)
├── Credits (Complex)
│   ├── Cast Group (Acting Only)
│   │   ├── Person Selection
│   │   ├── Department: "Acting" (Fixed)
│   │   └── Acting Job (Character/Role)
│   └── Crew Group (All Departments)
│       ├── Person Selection  
│       ├── Department Selection (12 options)
│       └── Department Jobs (Conditional, 800+ total)
│           ├── Directing (27 jobs)
│           ├── Writing (43 jobs)
│           ├── Production (100+ jobs)
│           ├── Sound (80+ jobs)
│           ├── Camera (80+ jobs)
│           ├── Art (100+ jobs)
│           ├── Visual Effects (120+ jobs)
│           ├── Editing (40+ jobs)
│           ├── Lighting (30+ jobs)
│           ├── Costume & Make-Up (70+ jobs)
│           ├── Crew (200+ jobs)
│           └── Actors (5 jobs)
```

## 🔍 **Validation Requirements**

Before theme completion, verify:
- [ ] All 800+ job options are included
- [ ] All post type relationships work
- [ ] All conditional fields display properly
- [ ] All group fields clone correctly
- [ ] All database tables map correctly
- [ ] All TMDB integrations function
- [ ] All admin interfaces are user-friendly

## ⏰ **Estimated Implementation Time**

Based on complexity analysis:
- **Cast/Crew System**: 40-60 hours
- **All Post Types**: 20-30 hours  
- **Database Migration**: 15-20 hours
- **Admin Interfaces**: 30-40 hours
- **Frontend Templates**: 25-35 hours
- **Testing/Refinement**: 20-30 hours

**Total**: 150-215 hours

This is significantly more complex than initially estimated due to the sophisticated cast/crew system with hundreds of job roles and complex relationships.
