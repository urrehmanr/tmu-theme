# TMU Gutenberg Block System Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Database Schema**: Well-defined custom tables with proper relationships
2. **Block Structure**: BaseBlock class provides good foundation
3. **Block Registry**: Basic registration system in place
4. **Some Block Classes**: Movie, TV Series, Drama, People blocks created

### ❌ Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Database Integration Disconnect
**Problem**: Blocks are not actually using the custom database tables
- Block data remains in post_content as JSON
- `save_to_database()` and `load_from_database()` methods exist but are never called
- No hooks connecting block saves to database operations

**Schema vs Implementation Mismatch**:
```php
// Database Schema uses:
PRIMARY KEY (`ID`) // References posts.ID directly

// But Block implementation expects:
'post_id' => $post_id // Field that doesn't exist
```

#### 2. Missing Database Fields Integration
**Problem**: Block attributes don't match database schema exactly

**Missing/Mismatched Fields**:
- Database: `release_timestamp` → Block: only `release_date` 
- Database: `production_house` → Block: `production_companies`
- Database: `streaming_platforms` → Block: not handled
- Database: `star_cast` → Block: not handled
- Database: `average_rating`, `vote_count` → Block: `tmdb_vote_average`, `tmdb_vote_count`

#### 3. No Frontend Block Components
**Missing Completely**:
- React/JSX components for block editor interfaces
- Webpack build configuration
- Block styling (CSS/SCSS)
- JavaScript asset compilation

#### 4. Incomplete Block Coverage
**Missing Block Types**:
- `TaxonomyImageBlock`
- `TaxonomyFaqsBlock` 
- `BlogPostsListBlock`
- `TrendingContentBlock`
- `TmdbSyncBlock`
- `VideoMetadataBlock`
- Episode and Season blocks

#### 5. No Legacy Data Preservation
**Critical Gap**: No mechanism to:
- Migrate existing meta box data to new system
- Preserve custom field data during transition
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Database Integration (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### Step 1.1: Correct Schema Integration
Fix the primary key mismatch and ensure blocks use the correct database structure.

#### Step 1.2: Add Data Persistence Hooks
Create hooks that automatically save block data to custom tables when posts are saved.

#### Step 1.3: Align Block Attributes with Database
Update all block attributes to match the exact database schema fields.

### Phase 2: Complete Block System (Priority: HIGH)

#### Step 2.1: Update Existing Blocks
Ensure all blocks properly map to database fields and include all required attributes.

#### Step 2.2: Create Missing Blocks
Implement all missing block types as specified in requirements.

#### Step 2.3: Add Database Mapping Layer
Create abstraction layer that maps block attributes to database fields.

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Priority: HIGH)

#### Step 3.1: React Components
Create complete React components for all blocks.

#### Step 3.2: Build System
Set up webpack configuration for block compilation.

#### Step 3.3: Styling System
Implement Tailwind-based styling for all blocks.

### Phase 4: Legacy Data Migration (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Step 4.1: Data Migration Scripts
Create scripts to migrate existing meta box data to new system.

#### Step 4.2: Backward Compatibility
Ensure existing data remains accessible during transition.

## Detailed Implementation

### Critical Fix 1: Database Integration

The most critical issue is that blocks are not actually saving to the custom database tables. Here's what needs to be implemented:

1. **Hook Integration**: Add hooks to BlockRegistry that trigger database saves
2. **Schema Alignment**: Fix the primary key relationship
3. **Field Mapping**: Create complete mapping between block attributes and database fields

### Critical Fix 2: Complete Database Schema Mapping

Each block needs to handle ALL fields in the corresponding database table:

**Movies Table**: 47 fields → Block handles only ~20
**TV Series Table**: 52 fields → Block handles only ~25
**Dramas Table**: 48 fields → Block handles only partial set

### Critical Fix 3: Missing Frontend Architecture

No React components exist for the block editor interfaces. This means:
- Blocks don't appear in WordPress editor
- No user interface for data entry
- No build system to compile block assets

## Success Criteria

✅ **Data Integrity**: All block data stored in custom tables, not post meta
✅ **Legacy Preservation**: Existing data remains intact and accessible
✅ **Complete Feature Parity**: All TMU plugin functionality replicated
✅ **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries using custom table indexes
✅ **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation between UI (React) and data (PHP)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix database integration disconnect
2. **Priority**: Complete missing block implementations  
3. **Essential**: Create React frontend components
4. **Important**: Implement legacy data migration
5. **Final**: Testing and optimization

This analysis reveals that while good foundational work has been done, the core requirement of database integration has not been implemented, making the current system non-functional for the intended purpose.
